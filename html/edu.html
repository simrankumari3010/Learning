                <p>Full stack developers are perhaps some of the most highly regarded professionals within the field of web development, but what is a full stack developer? Broadly speaking, they are web developers equipped to work with a digital entity’s front and back ends, meaning they are usually skilled with aspects of computer programming, user experience (UX) design, project management, and in many cases, client communication. This specialized hybridization has generally increased the demand for full stack developers in a variety of professional capacities.</p>

                <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.</p>

                <a href="#" class="list-group-item-action list-group-item-success"><u>JAVA</u></a>
                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. </p>

                <a href="#" class="list-group-item-action list-group-item-success"><u>PHP</u></a>
                <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
